        WebGL.

In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at 
which we want it to render our app. It's a good idea to use the width and height 
of the area we want to fill with our app The Cube- in this case, the width and 
height of the browser window.

        The below code creates a simple cube at the center of the screen. 
        We can make any object using 
        THREE.Mesh. The Mesh takes two objects, geometry and material. The geometry 
        of a mesh defines its shape, and materials determine the surface properties 
        of objects.

To create a cube, we need BoxGeometry and a primary material (MeshBasicMaterial) 
with the color 0xffffff. If the wireframe property is set to true, it tells Three.js
 to show us a wireframe and not a solid object.
